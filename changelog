01. SSH arbitrary arguments should be handled.
Res It is capable of handling arbitrary the SSH parameters now.

	I've also added switch for default behavior of the notorious
	-tt parameter. It can be used by the SSH to force terminal
	allocation. But it will merge the stderr and stdout streams.

	By default, I'm adding -tt, so that interactive commands run.

	But in special case where you don't have interactive commands
	and may want to	catch the stderr and stdout separately then
	please use the -noft or --no-forced-terminals or -nott.

01. SCP and SSH status were messing up while printing
Res It was due to \# where \\# had to be used

02. Wanted to remove temp dir in same SSH call
Res Did this using (sub-shells) as (exit) won't exit parent
	so sourced scripts even if they exit removals will go on

03. What happens when the same script from same place is
	to be run parallely? The generated scripts will overwrite
	each other!
Res If commands file is not in rxossh-XXXXXXX kind of dir mktemp
	dir in the same dir of commands file.
