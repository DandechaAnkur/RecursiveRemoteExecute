01. SCP and SSH status were messing up while printing
Res It was due to \# where \\# had to be used

02. Wanted to remove temp dir in same SSH call
Res Did this using (sub-shells) as (exit) won't exit parent
	so sourced scripts even if they exit removals will go on

03. What happens when the same script from same place is
	to be run parallely? The generated scripts will overwrite
	each other!
Res If commands file is not in rxossh-XXXXXXX kind of dir mktemp
	dir in the same dir of commands file.
