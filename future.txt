issue:
try remembering why -tt I added?
resolution:
.   to avoid error log stating 'stdin not there so won't create shell or something'
    but even after errorneous log it used to execute commands
.   also -tt merges both stdin and stdout to stdout

issue:
verbose and coloring are different
event being less verbose coloring can be used
separate them
resolution:
.   removed coloring altogether .. it felt like unnecessary clutter
.   the -v switch will add descriptive logs of on what shell what's getting executed that's all
.   if no -v then no other log is present
.   when -v these logs are added going to stderr

issue:
add option to run absent script through scping it
suggest this to rxossh using again some kind of a label
resolution:
.   future

issue:
need to scp runner files with distinctive numbers
problem: when sshing to localhost command files will get overwritten
problem: 2+ guys ssh to same machine command files will get overwritten
can use src/dest port something which makes the connections unique
resolution:
.   using mktemp -d solves this
